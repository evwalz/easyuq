# Examples from Weather forecasting:

1. Temperature forecasts: EasyUQ applied to deterministic forecasts provided by [WeatherBench](https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench)

2. Precipitation forecasts: EasyUQ applied to deterministic foreacsts provided by case study in [IDR paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12450)

3. C++ functions for CRPS computation in [cpp_funcs_crps](https://github.com/evwalz/easyuq/tree/main/Weather_example/cpp_func_crps)
